/**
 * This class is a central repository for information about a WordLL game
 * It stores a mystery word and all word guesses tried so far
 * It keeps a history of the past word guesses in a linked list structure
 * 
 * I designed my code using a methodical approach involving identifying all the necessary methods and classes and fulfilling the functionality for each of them. 
 * I found it easiest to go through the methods in the order outlined in the assignment and taking breaks if I got stuck.
 * However, while testing the code, I faced the challenge of struggling to pass the 12th test case. 
 * After using print statements to finalize what methods the word was being run through, I found that my labelWord function did not have the correct values run through the ExtendedLetter equals() method, so their related value was not correctly updated. 
 * After consulting with the course TAs, I discovered that I was running the mystery word as a parameter in the equals function instead of the guess word, which led to the issue.
 * To test the code, I created my own test cases based on the TestWordLL.java file, as well as playing the game using the WordLLExamples.java and words.txt functionality.
